## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my spin on this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Its users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
-   Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
    -   The `input` field is empty
    -   The email address is not formatted correctly
